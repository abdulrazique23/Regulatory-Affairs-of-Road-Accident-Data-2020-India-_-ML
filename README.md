# 🚦 Road Accident Data Analysis (India - 2020)

This project analyzes road accident data for various *Million Plus Cities in India* for the year 2020. It explores the causes, outcomes, and city-wise distribution of accidents using data visualization techniques with *Pandas, **Matplotlib, and **Seaborn*.

## 📁 Dataset

*File Used:* Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data 2020 India (1).csv  
*Source:* Government of India Open Data (if applicable, otherwise mention as "provided")

### Columns:

- *Million Plus Cities* – Cities with a population over 1 million
- *Cause category* – Broad category of accident cause
- *Cause Subcategory* – More detailed reason for the accident
- *Outcome of Incident* – Injury, fatality, etc.
- *Count* – Number of incidents reported

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### 1. *Top 10 Cities with Highest Fatal Accidents*
- Bar chart representing cities with the most "Persons Killed"
- Helps identify high-risk areas needing attention

### 2. *Heatmap of Cause Categories across Cities*
- Shows how different causes vary across cities
- Visualized using a pivot table and Seaborn heatmap

### 3. *Custom Analysis – Cause vs Outcome*
- Separate mini-analysis done with synthetic data
- Compares fatal vs non-fatal outcomes for causes like Speeding, Alcohol, Distraction

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- Google Colab for execution

## 📌 How to Run

1. Upload the CSV file to your working directory (or Colab).
2. Run the Python notebook or script.
3. Output plots will display inline in the notebook.
